## What is it

A library of fake data and fake data generators.

All methods run synchronously and return directly with results. This 
can take a while. Good chance you'll hit the 15 second script limit.
You can of course implement your own enter-frame/timer to avoid this.

## Done

Nothing yet :)

## Planned

- Anglo Names
- Geospatial points, limited by:
  - AABB
  - Complex Polygon

.. Lots of other stuff if anyone cares to help build them.
